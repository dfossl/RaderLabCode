"CMJ177C","Ubiquitin-related modifier 1 homolog","Acts as a sulfur carrier required for 2-thiolation of mcm(5)S(2)U at tRNA wobble positions of cytosolic tRNA(Lys), tRNA(Glu) and tRNA(Gln). Serves as sulfur donor in tRNA 2-thiolation reaction by being thiocarboxylated (-COSH) at its C-terminus by the MOCS3/UBA4 homolog. The sulfur is then transferred to tRNA to form 2-thiolation of mcm(5)S(2)U. Also acts as a ubiquitin-like protein (UBL) that is covalently conjugated via an isopeptide bond to lysine residues of target proteins.

Catalysis occurs through a double-displacement mechanism. The nucleophile active site attacks the C1' of nucleotide 34 to detach the guanine base from the RNA, forming a covalent enzyme-RNA intermediate. The proton acceptor active site deprotonates the incoming PreQ1, allowing a nucleophilic attack on the C1' of the ribose to form the product. After dissociation, two additional enzymatic reactions on the tRNA convert PreQ1 to queuine (Q), resulting in the hypermodified nucleoside queuosine (7-(((4,5-cis-dihydroxy-2-cyclopenten-1-yl)amino)methyl)-7-deazaguanosine). {ECO:0000256|RuleBase:RU003777}.",-0.755539056452762,4.98710137873179e-13,21.4019669903463,-0.315975977050107,0.00123957903960772,2.11482198221029,0.0467260555787501,0.664831637391891,0.0190745780319522,-1.00406204313182,6.57777097341259e-25,55.907109739691

The scissile phosphodiester is attacked by the catalytic tyrosine of the enzyme, resulting in the formation of a DNA-(3'-phosphotyrosyl)-enzyme intermediate and the expulsion of a 5'-OH DNA strand. The free DNA strand then undergoes passage around the unbroken strand thus removing DNA supercoils.

It facilitates the passage of RNA polymerase II and transcription by promoting the dissociation of one histone H2A-H2B dimer from the nucleosome, then subsequently promotes the reestablishment of the nucleosome following the passage of RNA polymerase II. {ECO:0000256|RuleBase:RU364013}.",0.515533008647345,1.82981352622222e-14,16.3073283952254,-0.283343751409445,6.66929547843199e-06,3.37688978915362,1.16231489673996,6.79517423805426e-83,219.908060677482,0.312409853997133,4.13493550680047e-07,4.59199495265246

D2 is needed for assembly of a stable PSII complex. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_01383}.",0.220474821365391,0.545199678956395,0.133740725107716,-0.0241201409748677,0.951854671934463,0.00119015797847153,0.0704067188757531,0.830658001597767,0.0130630597968033,-0.390705620455122,0.216151984493076,0.59847251056411

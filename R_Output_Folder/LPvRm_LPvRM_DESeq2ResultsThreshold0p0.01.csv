The FACT complex is involved in multiple processes that require DNA as a template such as mRNA elongation, DNA replication and DNA repair. During transcription elongation the FACT complex acts as a histone chaperone that both destabilizes and restores nucleosomal structure. It facilitates the passage of RNA polymerase II and transcription by promoting the dissociation of one histone H2A-H2B dimer from the nucleosome, then subsequently promotes the reestablishment of the nucleosome following the passage of RNA polymerase II. {ECO:0000256|RuleBase:RU367052}.",5691.39212281164,1.02334466619876,0.180913092025227,5.65655395495676,1.54442442844864e-08,2.46658076193983e-07,15.5704579966681
